🔐 What Is AWS Secrets Manager?
It's a safe vault in AWS to store passwords, API keys, or DB credentials.



What’s the Problem?
You’re building an app (like in Python or Node.js), and it needs a username and password to connect to something (like a database).

But you don’t want to write secrets in code (it’s dangerous!).

You want to:

Store the secret safely

Let your app read it securely

Automate it using Terraform


Store a secret (like a DB username/password)

Create a role that can read it

Use Python code to read the secret at runtime

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# Create a secret (username/password)
resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "db_secret" {
  name = "/dev/myapp/db"
}

# Store the actual secret values
resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "db_secret_value" {
  secret_id     = aws_secretsmanager_secret.db_secret.id
  secret_string = jsonencode({
    username = "myapp_user",
    password = "StrongPassword123!"
  })
}
