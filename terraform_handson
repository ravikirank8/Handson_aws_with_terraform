AWS Provider
Terraform uses providers to interact with cloud services. The AWS provider is used to manage AWS resources. 
You need to configure the provider with the necessary credentials before managing AWS services.

provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-west-2"
  access_key = "your_access_key"
  secret_key = "your_secret_key"
}


From configuring AWS provider credentials to managing sensitive data and understanding the basic structure of a Terraform project

resource aws_instance ec2_instance {
  ami = ami-abcd
  type = t2.micro
}

Additionally, we'll delve into backend configurations for remote state storage and integrate AWS Secrets Manager for enhanced security.
